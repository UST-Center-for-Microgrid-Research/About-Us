# Center for Microgrid Research at the University of St. Thomas

The Center for Microgrid Research is dedicated to improving the reliability and resiliency of our electric grid. Through our educational programs, research, and partnerships, we are building the human and operational capacity needed for the 21st century grid.

## What is a microgrid?

A microgrid is a local energy system that can operate independently or in coordination with the main grid. It can provide power to critical loads, such as hospitals, military bases, or remote communities, in the event of a grid outage or disruption. It can also integrate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or batteries, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency.

## What do we do?

We are one of the only student-focused microgrid research facilities in the nation. We offer:

- A state-of-the-art microgrid laboratory with various generation and storage devices, such as diesel generators, photovoltaic arrays, flywheels, and supercapacitors.
- A cyber-physical and hardware-in-the-loop testing platform that can simulate different scenarios and conditions for microgrid operation and control.
- A data acquisition system that collects and analyzes real-time data from the microgrid and other sources, such as weather stations, smart meters, and sensors.
- Workshops and trainings for students, faculty, industry partners, and community members on microgrid design, operation, and management.
- Research projects and publications on topics such as microgrid optimization, protection, cybersecurity, and economics.
